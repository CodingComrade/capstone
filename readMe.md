# Hockey Statistics Webpage

## How It's Made:

**Tech Used:**  JavaScript, Java, Hibernate, Maven, Spring, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, MySQL

My goal with this project was to make a webpage for stat nerds like myself using data retrieved from an NHL tournament. I enjoy looking over sports statistics and generating conclusions and storylines from the data.

## Optimizations

I've learned in tech that all projects are ongoing, so in the future I'd like to add pictures of the player's face and add some animations.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that there is almost always a way to futher automate and optimize something and that hard coding is almost never the answer to a problem. I originally placed the data into an excel spreadsheet and after learning about databases, I found a way to transfer the data from excel over to MySql which helped me avoid hard coding the data.
